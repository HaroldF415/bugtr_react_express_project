# Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HaroldF415/bugtr_react_express_project_FE.git

```

Navigate to the project root directory:

```sh
cd bugtr_react_express_project_BE
```

2. Install dependencies: let's be fancy and only use `i` instead of `install`

```sh
npm i
```

3. In order for this app to fully work we must also clone the backend repo and follow the instructions there to get the backend up and running. Here is the link to the backend repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HaroldF415/bugtr_react_express_project_BE.git
```

4. Now that we have the backend repo cloned and running, we can start the frontend by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

5. The frontend should be running on port 3000 and the backend should be running on port 3001. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to me.
